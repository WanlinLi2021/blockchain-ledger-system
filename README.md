1. In the `Block` class, rename the `data` attribute to `record`.

2. Set the data type of the `record` attribute to `Record`.

### Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

Code additional input areas for the user interface of your Streamlit application. Create these input areas to capture the sender, receiver, and amount for each transaction that youâ€™ll store in the `Block` record. To do so, complete the following steps:
